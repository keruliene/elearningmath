                The partner meeting and working seminar started with registration and welcoming coffee. After then
                all
                participants from all three institutions introduced to themselves. There were participating project
                manager,
                coordinators and teachers in this meeting. Project manager Sandra Bidzāne from RSTS told about the
                project,
                its aims, activities, results etc. Project coordinators Arita Ošiņa (RSTS) and Rainer Kuutma (VCVTC)
                as well
                as teacher Katriina Karkimo (PIC) presented their school and experience in e-studies, and told about
                working
                with e-learning materials. There are rather many differences among these three schools. RSTS has the
                biggest
                number of students and staff, there are also many specialities provided in RSTS. PIC and VCVTC are
                smaller
                educational institutions, but they are more experienced in working in e-environment and with
                e-learning
                materials than RSTS. All partner schools are working in Moodle. PIC is using different interactive
                on-line
                tools to make learning more attractive and interesting for their students. RSTS and VCVTC mainly are
                using
                PowerPoint presentations, lessons notes, different materials in PDF and tests as e-learning
                materials.
                Mathematics teachers Elita Kazakēviča (RSTS), Alexander Kainberg (PIC) and Sille Allik (VCVTC) told
                about
                teaching mathematics in their schools. There are also many differences. RSTS in the only school with
                final
                state examinations, which are the same as for the gymnasium and secondary school students. PIC and
                VCVTC
                haven’t final examinations at all. There is a huge difference in amount of mathematics lessons. RSTS
                has the
                biggest one. Also the most complicated mathematics topics are in RSTS.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In conclusion of the first day project manager and coordinators discussed about the project budget
                and
                project money for partners that RSTS hasn’t transferred yet due to complicated system in state
                institutions
                of Latvia.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Late in the evening project participants went to the Folk club ALA, where had a nice dinner.

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold pt-5">14.09.2017/ Day No.2</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The second day began with the partner meeting and conversations about project
                documentation, reports and next activities in Porvoo. At the beginning coordinators from PIC and
                VCVTC were unpleasantly surprised about all the complicated reporting that offered RSTS according to
                its previous experience in international projects. As coordinator from RSTS Arita Ošiņa went to the
                Nordplus seminar on September 15, she found out that it is possible to use more simple reporting and
                documentation. So project partners don’t have to make agreements on voluntary work, it will be
                enough with timesheets in the end of the project. Partners don’t have to submit originals of the
                invoices, tickets, cheques etc. regarding the travel and accommodation, it is enough with the copies
                and one report with all travel and accommodation costs for every meeting.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">During the first part of working seminar teachers started to work with
                development of inquiry form for the students. Teachers of every school worked in the groups and
                wrote down some questions for this form. After then each group presented its questions and all
                seminar participants discussed about these questions. All seminar participants agreed on Katriina’s
                idea to divide the inquiry form in several parts. The first is background information, like gender,
                age and study program. The second part is about attitudes towards mathematics and studies in
                general. The third part is about materials used in learning mathematics. Then come 10 mathematics
                exercises. The last question is about student’s ideas for development new means for learning
                mathematics.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The last question is about student’s ideas for development new means for
                learning mathematics.
                In the second part of working seminar all 5 teachers worked together and wrote down mathematics
                exercises. At the beginning teachers had written down more than 10 exercises, but then all decided
                to reduce the number to 10 in order to have the inquiry form rather short and concrete. Katriina put
                all questions in Google Form as all had decided before. The Google Form allows to get a summary of
                all responses that is needed for this project.</p>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold pt-5">15.09.2017/ Day No.3</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">There was only working seminar in the third meeting day, but project manager and
                coordinators from RSTS and VCVTC also participated in order to help their teachers with English.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">In the first part of day teachers worked in groups – Estonian teachers together
                with Latvian teachers and both Swedish teachers in one group. They had to discuss about the form and
                content of the e-learning material in mathematics that has to be developed within the project. After
                lunch teachers presented their first ideas. Alexander from PIC showed 3 internet platforms where is
                possible to make different kind of exercises, tests etc. in attractive form. Estonian teacher showed
                one more platform. It was decided to use these 4 platforms for the development of e-learning
                material. All teachers got a homework to make at least 3 exercises in one or several of these
                platforms. These exercises should be developed based on the results of students’ survey in each
                school. Teachers have to present the exercises or explanation material during the next meeting in
                Porvoo in November 2017.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">In the conclusion of the meeting project manager and coordinator from RSTS
                informed all participants about the tasks and deadlines until the meeting in Porvoo on November
                8-10, 2017.</p>

                In the first meeting day PIC was presented, its curriculum and the students' viewpoint on the
                college and study opportunities. Over the course of the day, the project participants – RSTS, PIC
                and VCVTC presented the results of the questionnaire. As a result of the mathematics teachers'
                presentations, the data of all the participant countries questionnaires were compared and the common
                issues affecting all learners on the most challenging study topics were assessed and discussed. The
                results of the survey once again confirmed that the problems of mathematics acquisition are similar
                in all countries. For learners, mathematics seems to be difficult, often they do not see its link
                with real life, but at the same time, learners believe that mathematics is important and needed in
                their future professions. The students’ answers highlighted that they would love to master
                mathematics. Many suggested ideas for more attractive and interesting teaching materials. The
                results of the proposed mathematics tasks have revealed that the worst outcomes are obtained solving
                percentages, unit measurements and different equations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Later, the PIC teachers introduced their college premises and study directions. The seminar
                participants went on a college tour to get acquainted with school, classrooms, training and leisure
                activities.

            <p class="text-justify">
                Over the course of the day, teachers from the project participant countries introduced the e-study
                environments they use at their educational establishments and countries. The representatives agreed
                on topics for which teachers in each project participant country would draw up their mathematics
                assignments in the Kahoot internet platform:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Riga State Technical School – tasks for transition from one measurement unit to another;</li>
                <li>Porvoo International College – quadratic equations;</li>
                <li>Valga Vocational Education Training Centre – solving of percentage tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-justify">
                It was decided that the tasks should be tied to social situations that would be binding on the
                students in order to see the link between mathematics and real life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                While mathematics teachers discussed their issues, project manager and three coordinators talked
                about and planned the next meeting in Valga on March 7-8 in 2018. There were also discussions about
                the documentation on project expenses for travel, board and lodging and meeting organization as
                well.

            <p class="text-justify">
                In the evening all project participants and representatives of PIC had a tasty dinner in the nice

                The representatives of the project participant countries presented the tasks they had set up in the

                creation of the explanatory material for the theoretical material and tasks to be connected, and
                their link with possible e-study environments.

                At the end of the meeting, the results of the work concluded were summarized, and it was decided
                until the next meeting in the VCVTC, to offer learners to calculate the above tasks using the
                previously developed theoretical material in order to assess the progress of the students and make
                the necessary conclusions.

                At first participants of the project meeting got acquainted with VCVTC having a tour at the school
                premises and watching presentation prepared by the project coordinator of VCVTC Rainer Kuutma. After
                then the mathematics teachers presented the results of testing e-exercises and theoretical explanation
                material. Estonians hadn’t finished the testing yet, so only Finns and Latvians could share their
                experience. The greatest part of Finnish students admitted that they like e-materials on Kahoot internet
                platform. They also found rather exciting the competitive side of Kahoot. The PIC students think that it
                is possible to learn something from Kahoot.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Some e-exercises caused problems for the Latvian students, but they really enjoyed doing tasks on Kahoot
                internet platform. The RSTS students also liked to compete in Kahoot and they found e-exercises rather
                attractive. The students even asked to the mathematics teacher to give them exercises on Kahoot, so
                excited they were. Unfortunately many students didn’t read theoretical explanation material the teacher
                had prepared. If they had read it, very possible the theory would helped them to do e-exercises.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The next meeting task was to develop the second inquiry form in order to check results in mathematics
                for the 1st year students. The teachers decided to develop this form on the basis of the first inquiry
                form. There were added several questions about e-environment, Kahoot platform and other e-issues to the
                second inquiry form. The teachers have to do this survey during April and analyse the results.

            <p class="text-justify">
                During the second meeting day project participants developed support material/short guidance on using
                Kahoot platform for other teachers. This support material consists of simple instructions with nice
                pictures how to develop exercises on Kahoot internet platform. There will be developed also instructions
                for using similar internet platform.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In the end of meeting project participants talked about the final conference that will be held in Riga
                on May 23. There will take part all teachers, project manager and coordinators, as well as students in
                the conference. RSTS will invite also mathematics teachers from other vocational schools and
                representative of the Latvian Nordplus administration. Arita as Latvian project coordinator will tell
                about the project in general. Kristīne will introduce with the project website. The teachers and
                students will share their experience in the project and present the project results. The teachers have
                to include 3 slides about the school in their presentation. The duration of presentation for the
                teachers have to be 10-15 minutes. The students have to talk approximately 5 minutes. The first school
                that participate will be VCVTC, the next will be PIC and as the last ones their experience will share
                RSTS teachers and students.
