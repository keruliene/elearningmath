                    The purpose of the project <strong>“Attractive e-learning materials for provision of qualitative education”</strong>
                    (NPJR-2017/10226) is to help students to acquire the basics of mathematics using e-learning materials in
                    order to reduce dropout and early school leaving of young persons and help them to bridge the knowledge gaps
                    in the mathematics. We have come to conclusion that insufficient knowledge in the mathematics is one the
                    reasons why young persons are leaving vocational school early. That is why so important to strengthen
                    knowledge and skills in the mathematics and develop logical thinking. The mathematics is on the basis of all
                    scientific and technical specialities and is absolutely necessary for the future studies and working life.
                    The main project activities include partner meetings, working meetings and experience exchange, surveys of
                    the students, development, testing and improvement of e-learning materials, development of support material
                    for the teachers, development of project website and final conference. The main project outcome will be the
                    developed e-learning materials in the mathematics that will help students to learn this subject easier and
                    make it more understandable. The other outcome will be support material for our teachers which will give
                    them short suggestions about work in e-environment. Participating institutions will strengthen mutual
                    relations and cooperation as well as create a stable basis for further international activities. We hope
                    that our project results will be useful also for other Nordic-Baltic schools in order to improve e-learning
                    environment.
